    "status": "August 2025",
    "description": "We probed SONAR text autoencoders to see if they implicitly learn \"correctness\" across domains. Turns out they do, but with a clear hierarchy: code validity (96% accuracy) > grammaticality (93%, cross-lingual) > basic arithmetic (76%, addition only) > chess syntax (weak) > chess semantics (absent). The hierarchy suggests correctness emerges from compression efficiency rather than explicit reasoning.",
